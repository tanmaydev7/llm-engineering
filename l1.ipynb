      "**Method 1: Simple Moving Average (SMA) Method**\n",
      "\n",
      "This method involves calculating the average sales over a fixed period (e.g., months or quarters) and extrapolating that trend forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Historical Sales Data**: Collect historical sales data for the past [X] periods.\n",
      "2. **Calculate Monthly/Average Sales**: Calculate the monthly/average sales for each period.\n",
      "3. **Moving Average Calculation**: Calculate the moving average of the last [X] periods (e.g., 6 months) to smooth out fluctuations in sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Formula: SMA = (Sum of Current Period's Sales + Sum of Previous [X-1] Periods' Sales) / Number of Periods\n",

      "Historical Sales Data:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Month | Sales |\n",
      "| --- | --- |\n",

      "| Feb | $110,000 |\n",
      "| Mar | $120,000 |\n",
      "| ... | ... |\n",
      "\n",
      "SMA = ($100,000 + $110,000 + $120,000) / 3 = $110,000\n",
      "\n",
      "**Method 2: Exponential Smoothing (ES)**\n",
      "\n",
      "This method uses a weighted average of historical sales data to forecast future sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Historical Sales Data**: Collect historical sales data for the past [X] periods.\n",
